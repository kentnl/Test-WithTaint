=head1 HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

Thank you for considering contributing to this distribution.  This file
contains instructions that will help you work with the source code.

The distribution is managed with Distar, which generally means you don't need
to understand anything you don't already understand if you understand how to
use C<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>, and all you might need for typical contribution is
internet access and a copy of C<git>.

There are a handful of files generated by the C<make dist> process, but they
are few.

=head2 Getting dependencies

If you have App::cpanminus 1.6 or later installed, you can use C<cpanm> to
satisfy dependencies like this:

    $ cpanm --installdeps .

Otherwise, look for either a C<Makefile.PL> or C<cpanfile> file for
a list of dependencies to satisfy.

=head2 Running tests

You can run tests directly using the `prove` tool:

    $ prove -l
    $ prove -lv t/some_test_file.t

=head2 Code style and tidying

Please try to match any existing coding style.  If there is a C<.perltidyrc>
file, please install Perl::Tidy and use perltidy before submitting patches.

=head2 Installation and use

You can just use C<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> as normal to build an installable
version of this dist.

    $ cpanm ./

Should be sufficient to build and install this dist, including any changes you
may have made.

Or if you want to mimic the release process and install a "shipped-like"
version:

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make manifest
    $ make dist
    $ cpanm ./Some-Tarball.tar.gz

=head1 Misc maintainer tasks

There are a few miscellaneous programs in the C<maint/> directory you may want
to pay attention to if you intend to add either new dependencies or new modules.

    $ cpanm --installdeps --with-develop .
    $ perl ./maint/gen_deps.pl

This process will automatically update C<./cpanfile> and C<./maint/provides.pl>
and you should manually communicate any relevant differences in C<./cpanfile>
to C<./Makefile.PL>, before committing all three.

    $ perl ./maint/readme.pl

This process will update C<./README.pod> if you changed any relevant documentation
in the main module.
